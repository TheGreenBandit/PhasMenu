# Building / Usage
to build you will need to have Cmake 3.5 or greater. 
download the menu zip or make your own fork and use command prompt to cd into the project folder
then make a directory called build
go into that directory and call cmake .. 
wait for the build files to generate and then just build the solution

to use the menu dll you will have to download extremeinjector or xenos, or for simplicity you can just use my loader to avoid all these steps

# info
a c++ imgui menu for the game phasmophobia. This is still a work in progress and has minimal features currently as I update it.
the project makes use of cmake, and minhook for hooking.
the menu has quite a few bugs as i am still working out the menu base. One of these is the pause menu will crash your game. 
currently i am using multiple header files for functions however in the future i plan to use il2cppinspectorpro's auto generated header files instead.

# Unique stuff
from what ive seen im the only person that has made use of rpcs for phasmophobia, a vital and awesome tool for modding as nonhost. id like to expand upon my features using this such as a force hunt feature, instakill player, and auto complete objectives and such
