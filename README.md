# info
a c++ imgui menu for the game phasmophobia. This is still a work in progress and has minimal features currently as I update it.
the project makes use of cmake, and minhook for hooking.
the menu has quite a few bugs as i am still working out the menu base. One of these is the pause menu will crash your game. 
currently i am using multiple header files for functions however in the future i plan to have them all in one file that can be updated at the press of a button. read my il2cpp util clas to see my current dunping structure that needs to be modified.
i also would like to then my external window into a in game menu instead. for now though i will make use of the external menu ive setup and an overlay for esp and notifications.
